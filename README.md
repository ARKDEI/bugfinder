Supports multiple programming languages (C/C++, Python, JavaScript, Java, PHP)
Generates reports in various formats (console, HTML, JSON)
Easy-to-use command-line interface


Note: While the tool's internal code and comments are in Italian, all output reports can be configured to display in English.

üîß Installation
Prerequisites

Python 3.6 or higher

Installation Steps

Clone the repository:

bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/bugfinder.git
cd bugfinder

No additional dependencies are required as BugFinder uses only Python standard libraries.
Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):

bashchmod +x bugfinder.py
üöÄ Usage
Basic Usage
Run BugFinder by specifying the path to analyze:
bashpython bugfinder.py /path/to/your/code
Advanced Options
BugFinder provides several command-line options for customization:
usage: bugfinder.py [-h] [-e EXTENSIONS [EXTENSIONS ...]] [-f {console,html,json}] [-x EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]] path

path: Path to the file or directory to analyze
-e, --extensions: File extensions to analyze (default: .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp, .py, .js, .java, .php)
-f, --format: Output report format (choices: console, html, json; default: console)
-x, --exclude: Directories to exclude from analysis (default: node_modules, venv, pycache, .git)
-h, --help: Show help message

Examples
Analyze a single file:
bashpython bugfinder.py myfile.py
Analyze a directory with specific file extensions:
bashpython bugfinder.py ./myproject -e .py .js
Generate an HTML report:
bashpython bugfinder.py ./myproject -f html
Exclude specific directories:
bashpython bugfinder.py ./myproject -x node_modules build dist
üìä Output Examples
Console Output
/path/to/myproject/app.py
----------------------
  Line 42: memory_leak
    Possible memory leak: memory allocation without corresponding free
    Code: ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);

  Line 78: sql_injection
    Possible SQL injection: use parameterized queries
    Code: query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '" + user_input + "'");

JSON Report
The JSON report is ideal for integration with other tools:
json[
  {
    "file": "/path/to/myproject/app.py",
    "line": 42,
    "type": "memory_leak",
    "description": "Possible memory leak: memory allocation without corresponding free",
    "code": "ptr = malloc(sizeof(int) * 10);"
  },
  {
    "file": "/path/to/myproject/app.py",
    "line": 78,
    "type": "sql_injection",
    "description": "Possible SQL injection: use parameterized queries",
    "code": "query(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '\" + user_input + \"'\");"
  }
]
